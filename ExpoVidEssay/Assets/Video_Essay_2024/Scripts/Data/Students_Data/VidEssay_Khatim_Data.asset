  vidEssayTitle: Redesigning Street Games to fit the Urban Play Context
  vidEssayDescription: "The game Stacker in collaboration with RMIT Creative and
    Future Play Lab has taken inspiration from the New Games Movement where this
    movement emerged when Stewart Brand developed one his first few games. One was
    \"Slaughter\u201D in protest of the Vietnam War and the other one was \u201CEarth
    Ball\u201D which is a battle to control Mother Earth.\r\n\r\nThe New Games Movement
    encourages everyone to participate and that no one should be left out. Stacker
    follows the same approach by replacing competitive play with cooperative play.
    The players have to work together to stack boxes as high as they can to reach
    the final goal height along the wall.\r\n\r\nStacker was initially inspired by
    a street game called Seven Stones but along with many play-tests and client requirements,
    some of the core elements were reimagined for campus context. Stacker got an
    opportunity to be part of the four-day playtest at RMIT Melbourne City Campus
    at the Melbourne International Games Week (MIGW) 2023."
