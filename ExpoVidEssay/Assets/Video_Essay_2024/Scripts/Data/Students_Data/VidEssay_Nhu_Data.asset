  vidEssayTitle: 'Play to Preserve the Past | Safeguarding Vietnamese Intangible
    Heritage through AR '
  vidEssayDescription: "Intangible heritage, globally, is under threat from aggressive
    urbanization and globalization, particularly in developing nations like Vietnam.
    UNESCO defines intangible cultural heritage as encompassing oral traditions,
    social practices, rituals, festive events, traditional craft skills, childhood
    play, and food-making traditions. To safeguard this heritage, technology-driven
    solutions, such as augmented reality (AR), have emerged as potent tools. AR,
    initially a concept of fiction, has transformed into a prevalent medium that
    blends digital and physical environments, allowing digital objects to coexist
    with real-world elements. Using AR to digitize intangible heritage is a powerful
    application of modern science in cultural artifact protection. However, this
    trend poses questions about the appropriate use of these advanced tools and their
    impact on preserved content, necessitating further research. With a dedicated
    lens on the oral traditions and social rituals intrinsic to Vietnamese culture,
    this research undertakes a nuanced exploration of creative practice methodologies
    and considerations for crafting immersive Augmented Reality (AR) experiences.
    Central to this pursuit, the research endeavours to respond to a pivotal inquiry:
    \"How can creative practitioners harness the potentials of AR for seamless transmission
    of intangible cultural heritage?\u201D "
